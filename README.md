## Project Description
This project aims to improve financial forecasting by leveraging the strengths of State Space Models (SSMs) and comparing their performance with traditional ARIMA models. The models are evaluated based on their ability to capture complex patterns and provide accurate forecasts using NIFTY 50 data from Yahoo Finance.

## Motivation

### Enhanced Forecast Accuracy
Financial forecasting is critical for investment decisions and economic planning. Accurate models can significantly impact financial strategies.

### Flexibility of State Space Models
SSMs are known for their flexibility in capturing dynamic patterns and seasonal variations, making them suitable for complex time series data.

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering NIFTY 50 financial data from Yahoo Finance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
3. **Model Implementation**: Building and training State Space Models from scratch and ARIMA models.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Results
### State Space Model from Scratch
- Achieved significant accuracy in capturing financial data patterns.

### ARIMA Model
- Provided a benchmark for comparison with State Space Models.

### Report Summary
- The detailed report provides a comprehensive analysis of the methodology, experiments, results, and conclusions.

## Conclusion
State Space Models show promise in improving the accuracy of financial forecasts when compared to ARIMA models. The project highlights the potential of SSMs to capture complex patterns in time series data.
